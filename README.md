# Quantified Self

Quantified self is a web app that allows a user to keep track of the foods they've eaten and save them to meals. The application is primarily built with jQuery to manage the user interactions and uses ES6 style and features. The site UI was optimized for mobile devices and is not responsive. For the best experience view the app on a mobile device or by using your browser's web-tools to simulate a mobile screen.
